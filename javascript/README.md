# JavaScript

### What is JavaScript
**JavaScript** was initially created to "make web pages alive." The programs in this language are called *scripts*. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called **Java**.

When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript". But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother" of Java would help. But as it evovled, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called [**ECMAScript**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), and now it has no relation to Java at all.

### ES6

ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.

ECMAScript is a scripting language specification on which JavaScript is based. [Ecma International](https://www.ecma-international.org/) is in charge of standardizing ECMAScript.
